# RPi_Antenna_Driver
 this repository contains a Python Tkinter GUI script for Raspberry Pi hardware to control an H-Bridge and read a pulse encoder. H-Bridge in turn drives single DC motor tuned antenna. The antenna must have a simple shaft encoder output such as a reed switch activated by a magnet attached to the antennas drive mechanism. One compatable antenna is called a "Screwdriver Antenna" such as those made by Scorpion Antennas, Tarheel Antennas, Hi-Q-Antennas™, among others. Another antenna might be a tuned loop with a multi-turn varable capacitor.
